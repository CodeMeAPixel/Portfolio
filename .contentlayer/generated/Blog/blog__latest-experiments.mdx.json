Here’s a look at what I’ve been working on lately:\r\n\r\n## NodeByte LTD Website Launch\r\nOne of my main focuses recently was getting a website live for NodeByte LTD. It’s now up as a dedicated space for everything NodeByte, giving visitors a clear look at our services and mission. It’s great seeing it come together, and I’m looking forward to expanding on it.\r\n\r\n## New Blog Site for NodeByte Hosting\r\nAlongside the main website, I created a blog specifically for NodeByte Hosting. The blog will serve as a platform for sharing tips, tutorials, and updates for the hosting community. It’s exciting to have a place to share knowledge directly with clients and anyone interested in VPS and Game Server Hosting.\r\n\r\n## Infinity Bot List Documentation Site\r\nI recently worked on a new documentation site for Infinity Bot List using Next.js. I chose Next.js for its speed, ease of use, and support for creating a clean, responsive user experience. This new site will make it easier for users to navigate our docs and find the information they need, adding a polished, more accessible experience for the Infinity Bot community.\r\n\r\n## Rebranding Git Logs to OctoFlow\r\nIn a recent rebranding effort, I changed the name of our Git logging and notifications bot from “Git logs” to OctoFlow. The new name better fits the octo theme and reflects the bot’s purpose more clearly: it flows GitHub updates seamlessly into Discord channels. This rebranding is part of creating a more cohesive identity across our tools, making them more engaging and memorable.\r\n\r\n## Upgrades and Improvements to CordX\r\nI also made some improvements to my file-sharing service, working through several issues to enhance functionality and reliability. These recent fixes should provide a smoother experience for everyone using it.\r\n\r\n## Experimenting with Bun\r\nAnother recent experiment has been with Bun, a new JavaScript runtime built for speed and efficiency. Bun combines the functionality of Node.js, npm, and bundlers into one package, with built-in TypeScript support and edge compatibility. I’m finding Bun to be an interesting tool, especially for high-performance tasks. I’ll keep testing and share more insights on how it might fit into future projects.\r\n\r\n## What’s Next?\r\nWith these updates, I’m now looking forward to scaling and simplifying both personal projects and NodeByte’s ecosystem. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to hear about—I’m always open to sharing insights from the journey!",
