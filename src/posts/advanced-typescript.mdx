# Introduction

TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern JavaScript development, providing static typing and enhanced tooling. While basic TypeScript usage is straightforward, mastering advanced techniques can significantly improve your code's quality, maintainability, and overall developer experience. In this blog post, I'll explore some advanced TypeScript techniques that can help you level up your skills.

## Conditional Types

Conditional types allow you to define types that depend on other types. They are similar to ternary operators in JavaScript and are incredibly useful for creating flexible and reusable type definitions.

### Example: Extracting Return Type

```typescript
type ReturnType<T extends (...args: any) => any> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : any;

function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

type AddReturnType = ReturnType<typeof add>; // type AddReturnType = number
```

Here, `ReturnType` is a conditional type that extracts the return type of a function. If `T` is a function, it infers the return type `R` and returns it; otherwise, it returns `any`.

## Mapped Types

Mapped types allow you to create new types by transforming existing ones. They are particularly useful for creating utility types that modify the properties of an object.

### Example: Readonly Properties

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;
```

In this example, `Readonly` is a mapped type that makes all properties of the `User` interface read-only.

---

## Utility Types

TypeScript provides several built-in utility types that can help you manipulate types in various ways. Some of the most useful utility types include `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, and `Omit`.

### Example: Partial Type

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

type PartialProduct = Partial<Product>;

const updateProduct = (id: string, updates: PartialProduct) => {
  // Update product logic here
};
```

`Partial<Product>` makes all properties of the `Product` interface optional, allowing you to update only specific fields.

---

## Type Inference

TypeScript's type inference system can automatically determine the types of variables and expressions, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

### Example: Inferring Type from Value

```typescript
const user = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
};

// TypeScript infers the type of user as { name: string; age: number; }
```

Type inference simplifies your code and makes it more readable by reducing boilerplate.

---

## Discriminated Unions

Discriminated unions, also known as tagged unions, are a powerful way to represent a value that can be one of several different types. They are particularly useful for modeling complex data structures and state machines.

### Example: Result Type

```typescript
type SuccessResult = {
  success: true;
  data: any;
};

type ErrorResult = {
  success: false;
  error: string;
};

type Result = SuccessResult | ErrorResult;

const handleResult = (result: Result) => {
  if (result.success) {
    console.log('Success:', result.data);
  } else {
    console.error('Error:', result.error);
  }
};
```

In this example, `Result` is a discriminated union that can be either a `SuccessResult` or an `ErrorResult`. The `success` property acts as a discriminator, allowing you to easily determine the type of the result.

## Conclusion

Mastering advanced TypeScript techniques can significantly improve your code's quality, maintainability, and developer experience. By using conditional types, mapped types, utility types, type inference, and discriminated unions, you can create more flexible, robust, and type-safe code.
