# React 19 Deep Dive: What Changed and Why

React 19 brings significant improvements to how we build applications. After upgrading several projects, I've compiled a comprehensive guide to the most impactful changes.

---

## New React Hooks

### `useActionState`

Simplify form handling with the new `useActionState` hook:

```typescript
import { useActionState } from 'react';

function LoginForm() {
  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(async (prev, form) => {
    const result = await login(form.get('username'), form.get('password'));
    return result;
  }, null);

  return (
    <form action={action}>
      <input name="username" type="text" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
      <button disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? 'Logging in...' : 'Log in'}
      </button>
      {state?.error && <p>{state.error}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

### `useFormStatus`

Get form submission status without prop drilling:

```typescript
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';

function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  
  return (
    <button disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Server Components Improvements

### Async Components

Server components now support async operations naturally:

```typescript
async function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const user = await db.query.users.findOne({ id: userId });
  const posts = await db.query.posts.findMany({ userId });
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Performance Enhancements

### Automatic Batching

React 19 automatically batches all state updates, even in async operations:

```typescript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  const handleClick = async () => {
    // Both updates are batched into a single render
    setCount(c => c + 1);
    setCount(c => c + 1);
    
    await someAsyncOperation();
    
    // These are also batched
    setCount(c => c + 1);
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>;
}
```

---

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

```bash
npm install react@19 react-dom@19
```

### Step 2: Update Type Definitions

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react@19 @types/react-dom@19
```

### Step 3: Migrate Form Handling

Replace form submission handlers with Server Actions and `useActionState`.

---

## Breaking Changes

- **Automatic ref forwarding** is now the default
- **Context as providers** syntax has changed slightly
- **Some legacy APIs** have been deprecated

---

## Conclusion

React 19 is a substantial upgrade that makes building complex applications easier and more efficient. The improvements to forms, server components, and performance are worth the migration effort.
