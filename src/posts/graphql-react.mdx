# Introduction

GraphQL has emerged as a powerful alternative to REST for building APIs. Its flexibility and efficiency make it an excellent choice for modern React applications. In this guide, I'll walk you through integrating GraphQL into your React projects, covering everything from setting up your client to handling mutations and subscriptions.

---

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing those queries. Unlike REST, where the server determines the data returned, GraphQL allows the client to specify exactly what data it needs. This leads to more efficient data fetching and reduces over-fetching.

## Setting Up a GraphQL Client

To use GraphQL in a React application, you'll need a GraphQL client. Apollo Client and urql are popular choices. Here, I'll demonstrate using Apollo Client.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

### Configuring Apollo Client

```jsx
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.example.com/graphql', // Replace with your GraphQL API endpoint
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const ApolloWrapper = ({ children }) => (
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    {children}
  </ApolloProvider>
);

export default ApolloWrapper;
```

Wrap your application with `<ApolloWrapper>` to provide the client to your components.

## Fetching Data with GraphQL

With Apollo Client set up, you can now fetch data using GraphQL queries.

### Example: Fetching a List of Users

```jsx
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_USERS = gql`
  query GetUsers {
    users {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const Users = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_USERS);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error : {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>
            {user.name} ({user.email})
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Users;
```

## Performing Mutations

Mutations are used to modify data on the server. Here's how to perform a mutation using Apollo Client.

### Example: Adding a New User

```jsx
import { useMutation, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const ADD_USER = gql`
  mutation AddUser($name: String!, $email: String!) {
    addUser(name: $name, email: $email) {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const AddUserForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [addUser, { loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_USER);

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await addUser({ variables: { name, email } });
    setName('');
    setEmail('');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} placeholder="Name" />
      <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} placeholder="Email" />
      <button type="submit" disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? 'Adding...' : 'Add User'}
      </button>
      {error && <p>Error : {error.message}</p>}
    </form>
  );
};

export default AddUserForm;
```

## Real-Time Updates with Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions allow you to receive real-time updates from the server. This is useful for building features like live chat or real-time dashboards.

### Setting Up Subscriptions

To use subscriptions, you'll need a WebSocket-based transport. Apollo Client provides a `SubscriptionClient` for this purpose.

```jsx
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';

const wsClient = new SubscriptionClient('ws://api.example.com/graphql', {
  reconnect: true,
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: wsClient,
});
```

### Example: Subscribing to New Messages

```jsx
import { useSubscription, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const NEW_MESSAGES = gql`
  subscription NewMessages {
    newMessage {
      id
      text
      sender
    }
  }
`;

const Chat = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useSubscription(NEW_MESSAGES);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error : {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Chat</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.newMessage.map((message) => (
          <li key={message.id}>
            {message.sender}: {message.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Chat;
```
